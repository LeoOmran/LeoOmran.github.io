			<h2><ins>Nasi Ganja</ins></h2>          
			<p>The dish Nasi Kandar  can be found in Ipoh. During our last trip to Ipoh we decided to have lunch at Yong Suan Coffee Shop.
				The official name for the dish Nasi Kandar stall is Perniagaan Nasi Kandar Ayam Merah. It is also known by another name Nasi Ganja, the 
				locals consider it as the nick name for the stall here. Everyone knows which Nasi Kandar a person is referring to whenever they ask for Nasi Ganja.<br><br>
				It gets very crowded and there are long queues of diners ordering the dish. But the queue is only for those who are taking away the food 
				instead of dinning there. If you are planning to have your lunch there, take a seat at any free table and the staff will come to you and 
				take your order. Just order any of the dishes you prefer, you can either have your order separately or on your rice added with a mix of 
				curry gravies. The service is fast and good, there are enough staff members to serve the diners, they serve each dining table in minimum of 5 minutes.<br><br>
				To sum up, we were satisfied with the food and we could tell what made the place so popular. The Ayam Goreng Merah is delicious and 
				we recommend you to try it, it is one of their main dishes. There were lots of food choices like, warm rice, fried chicken, chicken 
				curry, mutton curry, fish curry, squid curry, egg and others. However, the mix of curry skill is really good, you can take any of the
				curry they serve. Even when we asked for more curries, it was free of charge. Since we were sharing, we ordered a lot of dishes with
				friends and see how much it would cost us for a plate. It was a surprise that the price was reasonable, the fact that it is Nasi Kandar,
				it would cost almost cheap.
